## 📝 Overview
Tweeter is a powerful monbile communication with a wide audiences. This is very useful in time of emergency. However, it can be challenging for machine learning model to differentiate a text message to be classified as a "disaster" as some word can be use interchangably in a non-disaster situation. The goal of this project is to build a RNN machine learning model to predict if a tweet is about a real disaster.
